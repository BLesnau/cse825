                Please do not do any of the homework attacks that use ARP spoofing on the school network. We think that MSU is 
                watching the ARP cache and not allowing all of the attacks to work. If you don't have access to another network, 
                just turn in the command line arguments that you think you should have run.

            <br />

            <h3><b>The Goal</b></h3>
            <p>
                For this part of the homework we will be looking at a man-in-the middle attack involving the intecepting
                and sniffing of HTTP packets that were not originally meant for you. By making use of a sniffing tool combined
                with what is known as an ARP attack, we can both intercept and read packets that were meant for a different
                machine on the network. After you are done reading these packets you can forward them to the intended machine
                leaving the victim none the wiser.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't expect it to take this long to complete part 1 of the homework, but if you find yourself spending more than 
                3-4 hours on it, please ask us for help. We don't want anyone to be stuck for too long.
            </p>
            <p>You can use <a href="files/Part1.docx">this document</a> to fill in your answers so that you know exactly which information you need to submit.</p>

            <br />

            <h3><b>Getting Started</b></h3>
            <p>
                You will first need to get your Kali Linux virtual machine setup. We have directions for using <a href="vmware.html">VMWare Player</a> and <a href="vbox.html">VirtualBox</a>.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3><b>Traffic Sniffing</b></h3>
            <p>
                For this part of the homework, you will monitor different types of network traffic and report what you see. 
                You will use the "wget" command to download some apps that we have created for you to use, so just make sure 
                that you are downloading them into the directory that you want. Make sure you have execute permissions for 
                the files you download (chmod +x).
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Run Wireshark during these sniffing exercises.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>It can be found under Applications -> Kali Linux -> Sniffing/Spoofing -> Network Sniffers -> wireshark.</p>
            <img src="images/wireshark.png" width="60%" />
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                You may get some errors about certain libraries failing to load or warnings about sniffing while being root
                but these can be ignored.
            </p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                    <p>Select the network "eth0" which is the main ethernet network for the VM and click "Start"</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/start-sniffing.png" width="60%" />
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                You can filter what you see in Wireshark by using the filter field near the top of the application. You can 
                type into it manually or right click on items in the list and add filters based on them. For example, it will 
                be useful to filter by IP for this part of the homework.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p><u><b>TCP Sniffing</b></u></p>
            <p>TCP sniffing will allow you to see low level individual packets that are being sent across a network.</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    <p>Run "wget http://mitm.azurewebsites.net/AzureSite/files/tcp_client.bin"</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Run "tcp_client". This will send TCP traffic for you to monitor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Observe the traffic in Wireshark and report the following</p>

            </ol>
            <br />
            <p><u><b>HTTP Sniffing</b></u></p>
            <p>HTTP sniffing will allow you to see higher level web requests being sent across a network. Under the hood, each of these HTTP requests is made up of multple TCP packets.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                    <p>Run "wget http://mitm.azurewebsites.net/AzureSite/files/http_client.bin"</p>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p><u><b>HTTPS Sniffing</b></u></p>
            <p>HTTPS sniffing will allow you to see higher level web requests similar to HTTP requests. The requests payload in these cases are considered secure and will appear encrypted.</p>
            <ol start="9">
                <li>
                    <p>Run "wget http://mitm.azurewebsites.net/AzureSite/files/https_client.bin"</p>

            <h3><b>OpenSSL</b></h3>
            <p><u><b>Decrypting Messages</b></u></p>
            <p>
                We will first look at a simple example of how you can use OpenSSL to decrypt a message. It's very similar to how 
                it happens during a secure SSL tranmission between a browser and a website.
            </p>
            <ol start="12">
                <li>
                    <p>Run "wget http://mitm.azurewebsites.net/AzureSite/files/openssl_decrypt_homework.tar.gz".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Run "tar -xzvf openssl_decrypt_homework.tar.gz".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use "<a href="http://man.cx/openssl">openssl</a>" and the key that you just downloaded to decrypt the message that came with it. What is the decrypted string?</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p><u><b>OpenSSL Configuration</b></u></p>
            <p>
                For this part of the homework, you will be looking at how OpenSSL is setup on a Linux server 
                that we have created. You will then establish a connection with that server based on the 
                information that you find. The server's IP address is 138.91.119.153.
            </p>
            <ol start="15">
                <li>
                    <p>Run "<a href="http://man.cx/sslscan(1)">sslscan</a>" on the server.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>How many ciphers are accepted?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What are the server's preferred ciphers?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use "openssl" to establish a connection with our server using the EXP-RC4-MD5 cipher. Use Wireshark to capture this activity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Turn in a screenshot of the "Client Hello" request with the "Cipher Suites" section expanded under the "Secure Sockets Layer". 
                        You can get to this information by double-clicking the message that you want to look at.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What was the "openssl" command that you used?</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br />

            <h3><b>SSL DOS</b></h3>
            <p>
                A DOS (Denial Of Service) attack is is when an attacker interacts with a server to make it perform some operation repeatedly 
                with the hope of consuming most or all of the server's resources. These SSL DOS attacks are used in conjuction with many 
                MITM attacks because some servers revert to less secure behavior when their resources are overloaded, whether it's by design 
                or unintentional. An unlikely (hopefully) example would be a server reverting to HTTP traffic instead of HTTPS when the 
                server's CPU usage goes above 90%.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this part of the homework, you will be performing SSL DOS attacks on two different servers. The insecure server allows insecure 
                renegotiation and the secure server does not allow it. Their IP addresses are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insecure Server: 137.117.84.81</li>
                <li>Secure Server: 138.91.119.153</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p><u><b>Insecure Renegotiation Allowed</b></u></p>
            <ol start="21">

                    <p>What version of OpenSSL is running on the insecure server?</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Hint: Use "openssl" similar to how you did above in the OpenSSL section, but perform a GET request on the webpage. Make sure that you find the <b>OpenSSL 
                                                                                                                                                                   version</b>, not the SSL version.

                    <p>Navigate to the insecure server's HTTPS webpage (https://137.117.84.81) and observe what it looks like and how it loads.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use "<a href="https://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/">thc-ssl-dos</a>" to perform an SSL DOS attack on the insecure server. This is already installed in the Kali VM.</p>

                    <p>What is the max number of connections that you see?</p>

                <li>
                    <p>After thc-ssl-dos reaches the max number of connections, reload the insecure server's webpage. How long does it take to load? Does it load like it did previously?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What was the command that you used to perform this attack?</p>

            <p>
                Hint: Remember that insecure renegotiation is not allowed on the secure server. The previous attack will not work since renegotiations 
                will not occur repeatedly for the same connection. You will need to write a script that opens many secure connections with the server.
                Use the command that you used for the insecure server (step 18) as a starting point and open the connections in parallel. Use a 
                supported cipher that has the highest number bits.

            <h3><b>SSL Stripping</b></h3>
            <p>
                Make sure that you use Firefox for this part of the homework. We did all of our testing in Chrome and it was working fine until the day before our 
                presentation. An update to Chrome closed this hole and the attack was no longer possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this part of the homework, you will be using "sslstrip" to "strip" out anything that makes an HTTPS request secure so that you can 
                see the payload inside of it. The request can then be forwarded on as an HTTP request.
            </p>
            <ol start="31">
                <li>On your host computer (The computer that is running VirtualBox or VMWare), take a screenshot of the secure connection information for an 
                    HTTPS webpage. In Chrome, you can click the lock on the left side of the address bar.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <img src="images/secure-facebook.png" width="50%" />
            <br />
            <br />
            <ol start="32">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Run "<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/sslstrip.1.html">sslstrip</a>" simlar to how it was demoed in class. Forward TCP transactions from port 80 to port 1234.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        On your host computer, navigate to a secure webpage such as the one you navigated to in step 31. Take a screenshot of the website's secure connection information now.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Attempt to login to that website and observe what is output to your sslstrip log file in the Kali virtual machine. Take a screenshot or report the text inside of that log file. 
                        You may not want to use real credentials when attempting to login.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You will need to know your host (victim) computer's IP address (according to your Kali VM) as well as the gateway's IP address. (This is basically acting as the router's address if you were attacking someone's computer on a 
                public wifi network). You can find the IP address of your host computer by looking at the IP address shown in Wireshark while your host computer is performing some web activity. 
                You can find your gateway (router) address by using the route -n command.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are having trouble getting things to work or seeing strange behavior, try restarting your Kali virtual machine and/or clearing your recent browsing history on your host computer. 
                ARP spoofing can sometimes get things into a weird state and something needs to be reset.
            </p>

            <h3><b>TLS Renegotiation</b></h3>
            <p>
                TLS renegotiation allows a client and server who have already established a TLS connection to negotiate or exchange new 
                parameters or keys. This can be exploited with a MITM attack. If you can put yourself into the middle of the communication 
                between the client and server, you can use the existing connection to inject your own content. This can often be done 
                without the client knowing it has happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this part of the homework, you will be taking advantage of TLS renegotiation by injecting your own content in the middle 
                of a connection between a client (Your host computer) and a server.
            </p>
            <p>The server's IP address that you will be using is 191.238.51.50.</p>

                        Use "tls-renegotiation-poc.py" to perform a TLS renegotiation attack on the server's webpage from the Kali VM that results 
                        in a message being logged on behalf of the host computer. Navigate to <a href="https://191.238.51.50/mitm">https://191.238.51.50/mitm</a> 
                        on your host computer.

            <p>
                ...where {YOUR_CONTENT} is the web request that you are injecting. This should be the same format as the web 
                request strings that you passed to the openssl command previously. For example, a simple GET request could be "GET /". 
                Hint: You can look in Wireshark for help with retrieving this string.
            </p>
            <p>You may need to close the two "arpspoof" apps and the "tls-renegotiation-poc.py" app before you can use the internet normally on your host computer again.</p>
